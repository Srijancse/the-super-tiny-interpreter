 * we need to reference `fact` in the body of `fact` itself.
 *
 * If we create a "normal" closure for the function above, the `fact` (pun intended)
 * in the body will be unbound.
 *
 * A quick fix is to update the environment with a reference to the closure itself.

 * by which environment you want the interpreter to use.
 *
 * Some people call dynamic binding "late binding". That makes sense, cuz `callTimeEnv`
 * is definitely fresher than `defineTimeEnv`. We just have too many names though.
